# Enumerators (Enums) in Rust

Enumerators, commonly known as `enums`, are a fundamental data type in the Rust programming language. They allow you to define a type that can have a fixed set of values, which are usually related in some way. Enums provide a concise way to represent and work with different states or options within your Rust programs.

## Defining an Enum

You can define an enum in Rust using the `enum` keyword, followed by a set of variants enclosed in curly braces `{}`. Each variant represents a possible value the enum can take on. Here's a basic example of defining an enum that represents different colors:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue,
}
```

In this example, `Color` is the name of the enum, and it has three variants: `Red`, `Green`, and `Blue`. These variants are distinct values that a variable of type `Color` can hold.

## Using Enums

Enums are often used to model situations where a value can be one of a limited set of choices. You can create instances of an enum variant by specifying the enum name followed by the variant name, like so:

```rust
let selected_color = Color::Red;
```

You can also use enums in match expressions to handle different cases:

```rust
match selected_color {
    Color::Red => println!("The color is Red"),
    Color::Green => println!("The color is Green"),
    Color::Blue => println!("The color is Blue"),
}
```

Enums can also be associated with data. This is useful when each variant needs to carry additional information. Here's an example of an enum with associated data:

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64), // Circle variant with a radius
    Rectangle(f64, f64), // Rectangle variant with width and height
    Square(f64), // Square variant with a side length
}
```

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature in Rust that allows you to destructure enums and extract their associated data. Here's how you can use pattern matching with the `Shape` enum:

```rust
let shape = Shape::Circle(3.0);

match shape {
    Shape::Circle(radius) => println!("This is a circle with radius {}.", radius),
    Shape::Rectangle(width, height) => println!("This is a rectangle with dimensions {}x{}.", width, height),
    Shape::Square(side_length) => println!("This is a square with side length {}.", side_length),
}
```

## Conclusion

Enums are a versatile and essential feature of Rust that allows you to define custom types with a limited set of possible values. They are particularly useful for creating expressive and safe code in situations where you need to represent different states or options. By understanding and using enums effectively, you can write more robust and maintainable Rust programs.
