# Welcome to "The Rust" Lang!
Rust is a programming language developed by Mozilla that focuses on providing a high level of memory safety, while still maintaining performance. It aims to be a systems programming language, similar to C and C++, but with modern features and strong guarantees about memory safety, thread safety, and data race prevention.

Rust has a lower execution time and memory management better than C, C++, Java.
